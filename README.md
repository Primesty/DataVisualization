# DataVisualization
Data visualization - miscellaneous


This is just a place to gather and collect various scripts for data visualization and doodling...

The first script is an R-script that gets online data from a website and uses a shapefile of Germany to build a map with the data plotted on it.

The script is adapted from rbloggers: http://www.r-bloggers.com/mapping-with-ggplot-create-a-nice-choropleth-map-in-r/
